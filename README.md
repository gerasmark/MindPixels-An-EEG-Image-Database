# MindPixels-An-EEG-Image-Database
A database developed by transforming EEG signals into visual representations using Gramian Angular Fields.
## Abstact

In the realm of EEG analysis, the complex nature
of EEG signals often necessitates their transformation into
visual formats, thereby facilitating more accessible data analysis.
Despite this practice, there is a notable scarcity of datasets
available for such transformed EEG signals. Addressing this gap,
we introduce ’MindPixels,’ a database developed by transforming
EEG signals into visual representations using Gramian Angular Fields. ”MindPixels” stands out as a preprocessed, easily
accessible repository of EEG-derived image data, effectively
streamlining the traditionally time-intensive preprocessing steps.
We showcase the utility of ”MindPixels” by deploying deep
learning techniques for the classification of focal and nonfocal EEG GASF images. Our comprehensive evaluation of the
”MindPixels” database yields promising outcomes, reinforcing its
potential as an invaluable asset in augmenting the interpretation
of EEG signals.
